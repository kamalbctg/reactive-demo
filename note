Slide-1:
--------
In traditional approach describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state that is expresses the
logic of a computation with describing its control flow(How do).
In sort
    Declarative - specify what to do, not how to do it
    Imperative - specify both what and how

Further, Traditional application do not have back pressure support application might be overwhlemed by data sent bt DB
as a result as a result. Only way to control by using paging

Slide-2:
--------
Threads are not blocked or waiting for a request to complete. Instead they are notified when the request is complete /
the data changes. Till then they can do other tasks. This makes us to use less resources to serve more requests.

Publisher, is observable whom we are interested in listening to! These are the data sources or streams. They can be Hot or Cold
---------
Observer, subscribes to Observable/Publisher. Observer reacts to the data emitted by the Publisher. Publisher pushes the
--------
data to the Observers. Publishers are read-only whereas Observers are write-only.

Subscription, Observer subscribes to Observable/Publisher via an object called Subscription. Publisher’s emitting
------------
rate might be higher than Observer’s processing rate. So in that case, Observer might send some feedback to the
Publisher how it wants the data / what needs to be done when the publisher’s emitting rate is high via Subscription object.
Processor acts as both Publisher and Observer. They stay in between a Publisher and an Observer.  It consumes the
messages from a publisher, manipulates it and sends the processed message to its subscribers. They can be used to
chain multiple processors in between a Publisher or an Observer.
